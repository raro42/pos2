## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Table reservations**
  - **Staff**: Reservations list (`/reservations`) with filters (date, phone, status); create, edit, cancel, seat at table, finish. Table column always visible (name or "—" when not assigned). Permissions `reservation:read` and `reservation:write` for owner, admin, waiter, receptionist. Tables canvas: status "Reserved" (amber) when a reservation is assigned.
  - **End users (public)**: Book at **`/book/:tenantId`** (date, time, party size, name, phone; no login). After booking, link to **`/reservation?token=...`** to view or cancel. See `docs/TABLE_RESERVATION_USER_GUIDE.md` for URLs and flow.
  - **API**: `POST/GET/PUT /reservations`, seat/finish/cancel; public create (with `tenant_id`), `GET /reservation/by-token`, `PUT /reservation/{id}/cancel?token=...`. Reservation responses include **`table_name`** when assigned. Table status in `GET /tables/with-status`: `available` | `reserved` | `occupied`.
- **Documentation**
  - `docs/TABLE_RESERVATION_USER_GUIDE.md`: End-user flow, URL reference (book, view/cancel), testing steps.
  - `docs/TABLE_RESERVATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: Implementation plan (existing).
- **Agent / ops**
  - AGENTS.md: Docker status, port detection, and log commands.
  - Frontend debug script `scripts/debug-reservations.mjs` (Puppeteer: login, create reservation, cancel). `.env` for demo credentials (gitignored); `puppeteer-core` dev dependency.
  - Public user test `scripts/debug-reservations-public.mjs` (Puppeteer: open `/book/:tenantId` without login, fill form, submit, then view/cancel by token). npm script: `debug:reservations:public`.

### Fixed

- Reservation create "failed to create": DB columns `reservation_date` and `reservation_time` were `timestamp`; migration updates them to `DATE` and `TIME`.
- Reservations route and sidebar: Staff route `/reservations` before public `/reservation`; permission-based `reservationAccessGuard`; frontend build (Router, `minDate()`, `LowerCasePipe`).
- Reservation API: invalid date/time return HTTP 400 with clear message; parsing validates length and format.
- Reservations list: Table column always shown; API returns `table_name`; frontend shows name or "—" (`RESERVATIONS.TABLE_NOT_ASSIGNED`).
- Puppeteer test: create/cancel uses DOM form values and date filter; cancel confirmation works.
- Admin layout: main content full width (removed `max-width` on `.main`).
